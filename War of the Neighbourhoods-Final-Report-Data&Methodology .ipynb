The entrepreneurs have to take a variety of details into consideration, one of these details happens to be the location of their stores so as to attract an ample amount of customers. For example, if the owner of 'Nike' decides to put up shop right in front of an incredibly competitive store like 'Adidas', they might run into some unwanted competition with 'Adidas' which causes their sales to decrease. For this, it is prudent that the owner of 'Nike' chooses an area where they find little competition. Likewise, business owners could also run into trouble if their line of business is not popular at all in a particular area, i.e. there is very little consumer interest in their products in that particular area. Therefore, it is very important that business owners start their business in an area where their line of work is popular but not excessively popular (which increases competition) nor excessively unpopular (which lowers profits due to a lack of consumer interest). \n\nIn this project, we take the city of Toronto and we segment and cluster the various neighbourhoods of Toronto to find the best locations to start a small buisiness, for example - a restaurant,a toy store, a bank, a drugstore.

Yoga studios and dumpling restaurants being mildly popular. Drugstores and donut shops happen to be incredibly unpopular. New businesses like convenience stores, yoga studios and playgrounds are bound to be incredibly successful.\n\nCluster 3 (Colour - Green) - This cluster includes only 2 boroughs, namely- 'North York' and 'Etobicoke'. In both the boroughs, baseball fields and yoga studios happen to be incredibly popular while dumpling restaurants, dim - sum restaurants and East-European restaurants tend to be incredibly unpopular.
