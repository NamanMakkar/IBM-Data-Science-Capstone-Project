The entrepreneurs have to take a variety of details into consideration, one of these details happens to be the location of their stores so as to attract an ample amount of customers. For example, if the owner of 'Nike' decides to put up shop right in front of an incredibly competitive store like 'Adidas', they might run into some unwanted competition with 'Adidas' which causes their sales to decrease. For this, it is prudent that the owner of 'Nike' chooses an area where they find little to no competition.\n\nIn this project, we take the city of Toronto and we segment and cluster the various neighbourhoods of Toronto to find the best locations to start a small buisiness, for example - a restaurant,a toy store, a bank, a drugstore.
